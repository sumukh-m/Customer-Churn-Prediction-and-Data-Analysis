# Customer Churn Prediction and Data Analysis
"Customer Churn Prediction and Data Analysis" involves comprehensively assessing customer data to predict and understand instances of customer churn, where individuals discontinue their use of a product or service. Through data collection, cleaning, and visualization, important patterns and correlations are uncovered. Utilizing machine learning models like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, the aim is to predict future churn cases with a high level of accuracy. The process includes model evaluation, interpretation of features driving churn, and generating actionable recommendations for business strategies. The goal is to enhance customer retention by leveraging insights from predictive analytics and continuous monitoring of model performance in real-world scenarios.
